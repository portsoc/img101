<p>
    Making a pot of tea is a splendid thing. There is scientific evidence that drinking tea among friends can reduce
    blood pressure and increase wellbeing. <img src="i/teapot.png" class="teapot" alt="A picture of a tall creamy white porcelain teapot.">Some
    people drink a lot of tea, others prefer coffee (and they are wrong to make this choice, but we must allow them
    their folly).</p>

<article>

    <p>Images can be <code>float</code><em>ed</em> to the <code>left</code> or <code>right</code> of other elements.</p>
    <p>Inline content such as text will flow around the rectangular outline of the image.</p>

    <h1>Experiment</h1>

    <ol>
        <li>Try adding <code>float: right;</code> to the teapot class.</li>
        <li>Observe that the rest odf the article is also reformatted.  Add <code>clear: both</code> to the <code>article</code> to ensure that doesn't happen</li>
        <li>Try adding <code>padding-left: 4em;</code> to the teapot class so that the text stays further away.</li>
        <li>Notice the image is way through the paragraph. What do you think will happen if you move it to the start of
            the paragraph, after the p tag, but before the text?</li>
