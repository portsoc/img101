# Working with Images

We have prepared a collection of image examples that you can interact with on the web at: https://soc.port.ac.uk/img101 


# Download / Install

You should get a copy the source code by, either:
  * downloading [this zip file](https://github.com/portsoc/img101/archive/master.zip), or
  * cloning [this github repository](https://github.com/portsoc/img101).

We recommend you clone the repo, rather than downloading the zip, but if you _do_ download the zip file you should uncompress it to a folder on your local machine (do not just open the zip and use the examples directly).

# Use

Open the `img101`` folder in your preferred text editor - (we recommend you use [VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/) but if you prefer an equally capable or better editor that's fine - just dont use [Notepad](https://apps.microsoft.com/detail/windows-notepad/9MSMLRH6LZF3?hl=en-us&gl=US)).

# Task

For each page,
  1. look at _what_ it does, then
  2. look at the source code to see _how_ it's done, then
  3. look at the questions and suggestions in the page
    * To answer the questions you will need to edit the page.
    * You can open the page on its own by shift-clicking on the menu.
    * When you edit the page, reload it to see how it has changed.
    * Record your discoveries for each question
  4. When you have completed the examples, experiment.
