# Working with Images

Guidance on how to work with images on the web: https://portsoc.github.io/img101

How to look at it:
1. download the source code (from [github](https://github.com/portsoc/img101) or as [a zip file](https://github.com/portsoc/img101/archive/master.zip)),
2. click through all the available pages,
3. see what the page presents and what it looks like, and also see the source code for how it's done.
