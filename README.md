# Working with Images

We have prepared a collection of image examples that you can interact with on the web at: https://portsoc.github.io/img101 

You should get a copy the source code by, either:
  * downloading [this zip file](https://github.com/portsoc/img101/archive/master.zip), or
  * cloning [this github repository](https://github.com/portsoc/img101).

If you download the zip file,
  *  you should uncompress it to a folder on your local machine (do not just open the zip and use the examples directly).

Open the img101 folder in your preferred text editor - (we recommend you use [Atom](https://atom.io) but if you prefer an equally capable or better editor that's fine - just dont use Notepad).

## Task
For each page,
  1. look at _what_ it does, then
  2. look at the source code to see _how_ it's done, then
  3. look at the questions and suggestions in the page
    * To answer the questions you will need to edit the page.
    * You can open the page on its own by shift-clicking on the menu.
    * When you edit the page, reload it to see how it has changed.
    * Record your discoveries for each question
  4. When you have completed the examples, experiment.
