  alt="The University of Portsmouth crest."> Animations can make a page <em>feel</em> more responsive, and avoid jumpiness - but - you have to be careful with your CSS selectors.

<ol>
    <li>Observe the <code>:hover</code> pseudo selector on the <code>.exciting</code> class. When the image is hovered over, it flips end-over-end and grows in size. However, as it flips it becomes thinner until the mouse is no longer hovering over it, at which point the rotation begins to undo.  This is not what we want.
    <li>To solve this change the <code>.exciting:hover</code> selector so that it reads <code>p:hover .exciting</code>. This is saying that the declarations in this CSS rule will apply to an .exciting class which has an ancestor p element that is being hovered over.
    <li>Move the mouse anywhere over the paragraph and the image will flip smoothly.
</ol>
