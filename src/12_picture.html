<title>Responsive Images using Picture</title>

<style>
    img {
        height: 50vh;
        margin: 0 auto;
        display: block;
    }
</style>

<p>I caught a fish and it was this big:</p>

<picture>
    <source media="(min-width: 700px)" srcset="i/fish/thisbig.png">
    <source media="(min-width: 600px)" srcset="i/fish/thatbig.png">
    <source media="(min-width: 500px)" srcset="i/fish/sobig.png">
    <source srcset="i/fish/tiddler.png">
    <img
        src="i/oldbrowser.png"
        alt="This image contains text advising you that your browser is too old." >
</picture>

<p>The picture element can be used to create responsive images which choose an appropriate image basedon the size of the contaiing area.  In this case the container is the body, and the image is set to be 100% of the body width.  The bitmap that gets chosen by the browser depends therefore on the size of the window.

<p>NB: The img element is <em>required</em>.  The picture element provides the img element with a rich context and new mechanisms for selecting source images that are presented therein.  This is why when we style our image, we can styll style <code>img</code> directly.
