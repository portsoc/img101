<p><img src="i/teapot.png" class=teapot alt="A picture of a tall creamy white porcelain teapot." >Making a pot of tea is a splendid thing.  There is scientific evidence that drinking tea among friends can reduce blood pressure and increase wellbeing.  Some people drink a lot of tea, others prefer coffee (and they are wrong to make this choice, but we must allow them their folly).

<ol>
    <li>Try adding <code>float: left;</code> to the teapot class.
    <li>Observe the run-over on this list.
    <li>Add <code>clear: both</code> to the <code>ol</code> to ensure that doesn't happen
    <li>Notice the image is at the start of the paragraph, after the p tag, but before the text.  What do you think will happen if you move it half way through the paragraph?
    <li>Try also floating to the <code>right</code>
</ol>
